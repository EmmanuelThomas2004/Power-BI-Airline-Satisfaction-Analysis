## DAX Measures Showcase

This section highlights the key DAX measures created to power the dashboard's analytics.

#### Core KPIs
```dax
Total Passengers = COUNT(flight[id])

Satisfaction Rate % = 
VAR SatisfiedPassengers =
    CALCULATE ( [Total Passengers], 'flight'[satisfaction] = "satisfied" )
VAR TotalEvaluated =
    CALCULATE ( [Total Passengers], 'flight'[satisfaction] <> "" )
RETURN
    DIVIDE ( SatisfiedPassengers, TotalEvaluated )

Average Departure Delay = AVERAGE(flight[Departure Delay in Minutes])
Average Arrival Delay = AVERAGE(flight[Arrival Delay in Minutes])
Average Flight Distance = AVERAGE(flight[Flight Distance])
```

#### Service Rating Calculations
```dax
Avg Overall Service Rating = 
AVERAGEX(
    'flight',
    (
        'flight'[Inflight wifi service] +
        'flight'[Departure/Arrival time convenient] +
        'flight'[Ease of Online booking] +
        'flight'[Gate location] +
        'flight'[Food and drink] +
        'flight'[Online boarding] +
        'flight'[Seat comfort] +
        'flight'[Inflight entertainment] +
        'flight'[On-board service] +
        'flight'[Leg room service] +
        'flight'[Baggage handling] +
        'flight'[Checkin service] +
        'flight'[Inflight service] +
        'flight'[Cleanliness]
    ) / 14
)
```

#### Comparative & Segmented Measures
```dax
-- Passenger Counts by Age Group
Youth_Passengers = COUNTROWS(FILTER(flight, flight[Age Group] = "Youth"))
Adult_Passengers = COUNTROWS(FILTER(flight, flight[Age Group] = "Adult"))
Senior_Passengers = COUNTROWS(FILTER(flight, flight[Age Group] = "Senior"))

-- Satisfaction Counts
Satisfied Passengers = CALCULATE([Total Passengers], flight[satisfaction] = "satisfied")
Dissatisfied Passengers = CALCULATE([Total Passengers], flight[satisfaction] = "neutral or dissatisfied")

-- Satisfaction Rate by Class
Satisfaction % - Business = CALCULATE([Satisfaction Rate %], flight[Class] = "Business")
Satisfaction % - Eco = CALCULATE([Satisfaction Rate %], flight[Class] = "Eco")

-- Satisfaction Rate by Loyalty
Satisfaction % - Loyal Customers = CALCULATE([Satisfaction Rate %], flight[Customer Type] = "Loyal Customer")
Satisfaction % - Disloyal Customers = CALCULATE([Satisfaction Rate %], flight[Customer Type] = "disloyal Customer")

-- Travel Type Rating Gap
Travel Rating Gap = [Avg Rating - Business] - [Avg Rating - Personal]
```
