  Many passengers are not satisfied with their travel experience.  
  ‚Üí *Focus improvements on the lowest-rated service areas.*

- **Wi-Fi Gets the Lowest Ratings**  
  In-flight Wi-Fi is a major pain point for passengers.  
  ‚Üí *Upgrade Wi-Fi across the fleet and monitor user feedback regularly.*

- **Big Satisfaction Gap Between Classes**  
  Business class passengers show much higher satisfaction (~69%) compared to economy (~18%).  
  ‚Üí *Improve core comfort and service in economy class to narrow the gap.*

- **Delays Hurt Satisfaction**  
  More delays correlate with lower satisfaction scores.  
  ‚Üí *Improve on-time performance and keep passengers informed during disruptions.*
